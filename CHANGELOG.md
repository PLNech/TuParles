# Changelog

## Sprint 1 — 2026-06-11 · Première dictée: from empty dir to GPU-powered dictation

### Added
- Poetry scaffold, `src/tuparles` layout, architecture README (#scaffold)
- Bilingual spoken-punctuation post-processor with protected-phrase
  shielding ("virgule"→`,`, "rond-point" survives) — 27 tests (#punctuation)
- Demo spine daemon: Right Ctrl+Alt tap-toggle → mic capture → transcribe
  → punctuate → xdotool type into focus + clipboard (#1, #3-partial, #5)
- `GpuEngine`: persistent faster-whisper large-v3-turbo fp16 on the
  RTX 4080 — 29x realtime, ~1 s for a 20 s utterance (#spike)
- `QwenCpuEngine` fallback: vendored antirez/qwen-asr C binary (#spike)

### Fixed
- notify-send blocking daemon threads for 5 s (fire-and-forget Popen)
- Glued sentences from ASR ("question.Alors" → "question. Alors")
  without breaking filenames/decimals
- xdotool typing delay 12→2 ms (long transcripts felt like a UI freeze)

### Infra
- vendor/qwen-asr built from source (OpenBLAS, AVX); Qwen3-ASR-0.6B
  weights in models/ (both gitignored)
- Scoped permission: .claude/settings.local.json allows the vendored
  qwen_asr binary + its make builds, nothing broader
- cuBLAS/cuDNN via pip wheels with ctypes preload — no system CUDA

### Doctrine
- docs/spike-backend.md: full backend matrix. Whisper-family pays a fixed
  ~30 s encoder window per call on CPU; qwen scales with audio length;
  interactive streaming drowns on CPU. All moot once the RTX 4080 was
  discovered idle — GPU turbo is primary, CPU is fallback.
- Live partials design: re-decode the whole growing buffer ~1 Hz on GPU
  (≤1 s per call) instead of any VAD-segmentation pipeline.
